/*
In an imaginary country called Lisarb, 
all the people are very happy to pay their taxes because 
they know that doesnâ€™t exist corrupt politicians and the taxes are 
used to benefit the population, without any misappropriation. 
The currency of this country is Rombus, whose symbol is R$.

Read a value with 2 digits after the decimal point, 
equivalent to the salary of a Lisarb inhabitant. 
Then print the due value that this person must pay of taxes, 
according to the table below:

from 0.00 to 2.000,00 - without taxes
from 2.000,01 to 3.000,00 - 8%
from 3.000,01 to 4.500,00 - 18%
more than 4.500,00 - 28%

Remember, if the salary is R$ 3,002.00 for example, 
the rate of 8% is only over R$ 1,000.00, because the salary 
from R$ 0.00 to R$ 2,000.00 is tax free. 
In the follow example, the total rate is 8% over R$ 1000.00 + 18% over R$ 2.00, 
resulting in R$ 80.36 at all. 
The answer must be printed with 2 digits after the decimal point.
